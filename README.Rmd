# importAs

This package helps mimic the idiomatic python importing of packages such as

```{python, eval = FALSE}
import dplyr as d
```

In order to mimic this as closely as possible, the function `importAs` takes a 
package name and a (short?) name for that and creates a linkage

```{r}
importAs(dplyr, d)
d
```

or

```{r}
importAs("dplyr", "d")
d
```

This is merely a convenience, however. In reality a variable `d` is created 
with the value `"dplyr"` (and a class so we can dispatch on it). We could also 
do this manually for another package, creating a simple character object

```{r}
s <- "stringr"
s
```

The `importAs` function is merely a signal to a reader that this magic is going to 
be performed. The class means it is clearer that the shorthand is being used.

A custom description is provided within the RStudio Environment pane which 
identifies each shorthand and the namespace to which it refers.

As a further convenience, this [can be specified using an infix operator](https://github.com/jonocarroll/importAs/issues/1) (h/t @sa-lee)

```{r}
dplyr %importAs% d
d
```

At this point nothing magical has happened. The magic comes from overwriting the `::`
operator. To -- at least, my -- surprise, `::` can happily take a character argument 
for the left-hand side, so 

```{r}
## equivalent to "dplyr"::filter
base::`::`("dplyr", filter)
```

works. The magic part is rewriting this function to look deeper if provided with a 
symbol which already resolves to a character string representing an installed 
package. The result is that we can shorthand the namespace referencing

```{r}
d::filter(mtcars, cyl == 4, am == 1)
s::str_extract("a1b2c3", "[a-z]2")
```

without interfering with any existing functionality

```{r}
dplyr::filter(mtcars, cyl == 4, am == 1)
stringr::str_extract("a1b2c3", "[a-z]2")
```

## Collisions

If the symbol you are trying to use as a shorthand _already_ exists as an available 
namespace, then that will take precedence. This prevents accidentally overwriting 
a namespace reference

```{r, error = TRUE, warning = TRUE}
importAs(stringr, dplyr)
dplyr::str_extract
```

and the existing namespace will still be found

```{r}
dplyr::select
```

## Debugging

If you want to be clear about where your shorthands point to, you can set the 
debug option

```{r}
options(importAs.debug = TRUE)
```

which will turn on messaging whenever a shorthand is accessed. For example, using 
`dplyr` normally does not

```{r}
dplyr::filter(mtcars, cyl == 4 & am == 1)
```

but using the shorthand, we are reminded as to where that refers

```{r}
d::filter(mtcars, cyl == 4 & am == 1)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
options(importAs.debug = FALSE)
```


## Installation

You can install the development version of `importAs` with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jonocarroll/importAs")
```
